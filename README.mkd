# Vase: Data-driven microservices

This system provides a data-driven way to describe and run RESTful APIs that
are backed by a durable database (Datomic).

## Features

* Describe Pedestal routes as data
* Create and update Datomic schema

## Getting Started

Vase turns API descriptions into Pedestal routes. The API descriptions
specify actions for routes, these are turned into interceptors in the
Pedestal routes. This is done by `vase/routes`.

`vase/routes` takes an API base URL and a description. The routes it
returns can be used directly by pedestal like this:

```clj
(require '[io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table :as table])
(require '[vase]))

(defn make-master-routes
  [spec]
  (table/table-routes
   {}
   (vase/routes "/api" spec)))
```

The routes that `vase/routes` returns can also be combined with
hand-written Pedestal routes by concatenating the input to
`table/table-routes`:

```clj
(require '[io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table :as table])
(require '[vase]))

(defn make-master-routes
  [spec]
  (table/table-routes
   {}
   (concat
     [["/hello" :get [hello]]]
     (vase/routes "/api" spec))))
```
